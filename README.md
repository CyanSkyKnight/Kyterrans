The Kyterrans: Subterranean Ash-Desert Mining-Knight Antlions

Only my second species mod after like three years of modding. Where the Saturnians mod was focused on wizards, this one is focused on warriors.

Kyterrans are an antlion species from the same planet the Saturnians and Thaumoth are from, Myrasyl. (In fact, Kyterrans previously appeared as an NPC-only species within the Saturnians mod.)

This mod has taken way to long for me to finish, and I'm getting burnt out. I want to put this on hold to return to later.
That said, this mod as it is right now already has plenty of content though. I don't want to just hold on to this perfectly playable mod forever just because of writer's block and cosmetics.

Ok, so what isn't finished then?

-Some items have placeholder descriptions. (archer/mage armor, clothes, etc.)

-There isn't really a lot of lore in the mod.	

-Kyterrans are a bit lacking in clothing options.
